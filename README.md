**Steps to Run the Code**

# How to Use the Demo Notebook for Liver Segmentation

Follow the steps below to run the segmentation using the `demo.ipynb` notebook:

1. **Run All Cells**  
   Open the `demo.ipynb` file and execute all the cells sequentially.

2. **Set the Model Path**  
   Update the model path in the notebook to point to `wnet_weights.pth`.  
   Example:
   ```python
   model_path = "path_to/wnet_weights.pth"
